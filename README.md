# SDR-Receiver

This project is a Software defined radio, created on MATLAB.
Based on "Software Receiver Design: Build Your Own Digital Communications System in Five Easy Steps"
by -C. Richard Johnson, Andrew G. Klein, William Sethares.

In the handout.txt, there are the transmitter specifications for 3 different signals that were sent,
and the goal is to decode those mystery messages by:
-Filtering the signal
-Applying carrier recovery
-Demodulating the signal
-Applying matched filter 
-Applying time recovery
-Applying correlation
-Pass the results through an equalizer
-Do Frame Synchronization
-Decode the resulting signal

A report of the project is attached for more info if desired.
